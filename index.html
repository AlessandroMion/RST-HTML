      Hi, I'm Alessandro and this is a bit about myself. I am 17 years old and I enjoy playing video games like, GlopNop's Travel Through Space, Mario 64, Slporp's Adventure, <a href= "https://store.steampowered.com/app/635260/CarX_Drift_Racing_Online">Car Drift Race</a>,  and Critical Strike: Global Ops. I also like playing multiple sports like Hockey, Soccer, Football and Plorp. I enjoy relaxing on the weekends and I have a job at Fresh Air Experience and I help people out. I also really enjoy spending time with my family because they are very important to me and going on vacations is really fun too. My favourite place to go on vacation is Italy because I see plently of relatives there. I enjoyed this class and I plan to take classes related to this after.
